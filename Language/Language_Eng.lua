Hello Dimensioneers!\
\
This Addon is the continuation of Dimension Tools, originally developed\
by Kikimora with the support of the Rift Dream Dimensions team.\
And Dimension Tools is an advancement of Dimension Toolbox by Arkzy.\
\
The following is a summary of the core features:\
\
<u>Tinker Tools Features:</u>\
- Compact user interface giving you more screen space when building dimensions.\
  All the tools can be brought up individually with the buttons provided in\
  the main window.\
\
- Move, scale and rotate hundreds of items at once precisely in various modes.\
  (Though you must keep in mind that the more items you modify, the longer it\
  takes to finish processing it.)\
\
- The functionality of the Copy/Paste tool ranges from transfering selected values\
  between items with optional offset to cloning whole groups of items and placing\
  multiple copies in your dimension directly from your bags and/or bank.\
\
- With the Load/Save feature you can choose between loading one of the\
  default sets or your own saved sets. And for convenience you can place\
  multiple copies of a saved set at once with an offset on the X, Y or X axis.\
\
- The Import/Export feature allows you to export your saved sets to a file\
  and share that with your friends by just sending them the file. On their\
  turn they can choose which sets to import to their own saved sets.\
\
Thanks for all the support from the dimension community,\
and have fun building your dreams!"

Lang["English"].Move.Text2 = "\
<u>Descriptions:</u>\
- X/Y/Z: Specifies the coordinates for the X/Y/Z axis.\
  Empty fields will leave the associated axis unaffected.\
- Absolute: Moves the item(s) to the coordinates set in X,Y,Z.\
- Relative: Moves the item(s) with an offset from current position by the\
  numbers set in X,Y,Z.\
- As Group: Treats the whole selection as one object with the selection center\
  as position; only available in absolute mode.\
- Move: Starts the moving of the item(s).\
- Reset: Resets the item(s) to your current position."

Lang["English"].Move.Text3 = ""

---Rotate-----------------------------------------------------------------
Lang["English"].Rotate = {}
Lang["English"].Rotate.Label = "Rotate"
Lang["English"].Rotate.Text1 = "\
The Rotate Window is where you modify the Rotation of the selected item(s)."

Lang["English"].Rotate.Text2 = "\
<u>Descriptions:</u>\
- Pitch: Specifies the rotation about the X axis.\
- Yaw: Specifies the rotation about the Y axis.\
- Roll: Specifies the rotation about the Z axis.\
- Absolute: Sets the item(s) rotation to the exact numbers you put in Pitch,\
  Yaw and Roll.\
  NOTE: While empty fields will use the current values, there is always more\
  than one way to represent the same rotation. Rift may convert the angles if\
  your input exceeds certain boundaries, and hence chance all 3 values, which\
  may greatly confuse you on subsequent rotation adjustments. So it is highly\
  recommended to not leave fields empty in absolute mode.\
- Relative: Rotates the item(s) with the numbers you set in Yaw, Pitch and\
  Roll from the current rotation. So if current rotation is 30 degrees Yaw\
  and you put 20 degrees in the Yaw box it will end up having a rotation\
  of 50 degrees.\
- As Group: Treats the whole selection as one object. Note that since selections\
  are temporary, there is no way to save a current rotation for the group.\
  This has two consequences: This mode is only available in relative mode, and\
  the rotation happens around the global axis.\
  Note that you can rotate a single item around global axis too this way.\
- Rotate: Starts the rotation of the item(s).\
- Reset: Resets the item(s) Pitch, Yaw and Roll to 0 degrees."

Lang["English"].Scale.Text2 = "\
<u>Descriptions:</u>\
- Scale: Specifies the scale factor for the selected item(s).\
- Absolute: Sets the scale of the item(s) to the exact number you put in.\
- Relative: Sets the scale of the item(s) to the current scale multiplied by\
  the number you put in.\
- As Group: Treats the whole selection as one object. Note that since selections\
  are temporary, there is no way to determine a current scale of the group,\
  so it is only available in relative mode.\
  Warning: Items have diverse scale limitations. If you exceed those, your group\
  will fall apart, so to speak, because this mode also has to move items.\
- Scale: Starts the scaling of the item(s).\
- Reset: Resets the item(s) scale to 1."

---Copy and Paste---------------------------------------------------------
Lang["English"].CopyandPaste = {}
Lang["English"].CopyandPaste.Label = "Copy and Paste"
Lang["English"].CopyandPaste.Text1 = "\
The Copy / Paste Tool is pretty versatile, and behaves a bit different\
depending on what you do.\
When you copy a single item, you can paste its values to any other item,\
the item type gets ignored in this case, and individual values can be excluded.\
But the real power lies in the ability to copy a group of items and paste an\
array with incremental offsets, using items from your inventory."

Lang["English"].CopyandPaste.Text2 = "\
You can disable and enable any of the offsets by clicking the selection box\
in front of the text fields. When pasting to a single selected object, this\
also controls which properties are transferred to the selected item.\
\
<u>Descriptions:</u>\
- Offset X, Y, Z: Sets the offset for the X, Y, Z axis for the item(s) you\
  are going to paste the clipboard to.\
- Offset Pitch, Yaw, Roll: Sets the rotation offset for the Pitch, Yaw,\
  Roll axis for the item(s) you are going to paste the clipboard to.\
  For single items, the values are simply added to the original values.\
  For item groups or when a pivot is used, the items get transformed using the\
  global coordinate axis.\
- Offset Scale: Sets the scale change for the paste. For example, 0.2 will make\
  the placed copy 20% larger, and -0.2 consequently 20% smaller.\
- Offset multiple items: Makes it possible to paste an array by iteratively adding\
  the offsets to the values of the previously placed copy.\
- Flicker reduction: This adds a small offset to each placed copy to prevent\
  visual flickering from overlapping coplanar parts (Z-fighting).\
- Custom Pivot: This causes rotation and scaling to be calculated relative to the\
  point you picked (see below for details).\
- Use New Items: Activates the possibility to place new items from your bags or\
  bank into your dimension. Your inventory will be scanned to ensure you have\
  enough items before the pasting begins\
- Copy: Copies the stats of the items you have selected to clipboard.\
- Paste: Pastes the clipboard according to the settings you made.\
  This may take a while when placing many new items.\
\
Depending on the settings, additional controls become available, as seen below:"

Lang["English"].CopyandPaste.Text3 = "\
<u>Descriptions of additional options:</u>\
- Nr. of Copies: This will be showing up when Offset multiple items is activated.\
- Pick: This button is available when Custom Pivot is active and lets you record the\
  position of your current selection. This lets you for example build a spiral\
  staircase around a specific center point. The pivot is kept until you pick a new\
  one, and doesn't change if you move the item(s) afterwards.\
- Bags: Controls whether to include items from your bags to place new items.\
- Bank: Controls whether to include items from your bank (bags and vaults) to\
  place new items. Note that this has limitations when you don't have\
  actual bank access."


---Load and Save----------------------------------------------------------
Lang["English"].LoadandSave = {}
Lang["English"].LoadandSave.Label = "Load and Save"
Lang["English"].LoadandSave.Text1 = "\
The Load / Save Sets window is all about saving the sets you created to be\
able to load them up on other places in your dimension or in other dimensions\
you have."

Lang["English"].LoadandSave.Text2 = "\
<u>Descriptions:</u>\
- Name (Textbox):  Here you set the name for the set you want to save.\
- Save Set: Saves the set to file.\
- Default Sets: Gives you the possibility to load the default sets provided\
  by me and the rest of the RiftDreamDimensions team. These sets are tools\
  created to aid you in your creativity.\
\
  For a detailed guide on how to use these tools you can go to\
  http://RiftDreamDimensions.com and take a look at the\
  Dimension Tools PDF file.\
\
- Saved Sets : Gives you the possibility to load your own made sets into your\
  Dimensions.\
- Tbx Sets: Gives you the possibility to load your old Toolbox Sets, explanation\
  on how that works you find later in this help.\
- Name (Drop box): A list of all the saved items. Depending on if you have\
  chosen Default Sets or Saved Sets the drop box will go to different lists.\
- Load Set: Loads the selected set into your dimension using items you have\
  selected in your dimension or using items from your bags.\
- Print Materials: Print out a list of items needed for the selected set.\
- Load New Items: Makes it possible to load the set using items from your bags.\
\
The following items will only be active when Saved Sets or Tbx Sets are activated.\
- Delete Set: Removes the selected set from your saved list (only Saved Sets) .\
- Load at original location: If this is selected the set will be loaded with\
  the stats it was originally saved with. Otherwise the set will be loaded close\
  to your current position.\
- Place Multiple Copies Of Set: This activates the possibility to load multiple\
  copies of your set into your dimension and set a X, Y or Z offset between\
  the placed sets.\
\
The options used for this are shown in the picture below here.\
- Nr. Copies: Lets you set how many copies of the set you want to place in\
  your dimension.\
-X: Sets the X offset.\
-Y: Sets the Y offset.\
-Z: Sets the Z offset."

Lang["English"].LoadandSave.Text3 = "\
Tbx Sets is somewhat special. By default that set is empty, but for old Dimension\
Toolbox users this is a way to get your sets that you made with Dimension\
Toolbox to work within Tinker Tools as well.\
\
To get your old sets loaded into Dimension Tools you need to do the following:\
1: Locate the tbx.lua File, found under:\
   /Users/[YourName]/Documents/RIFT/Interface/Saved/[YourRiftAccount]\
   /SavedVariables\
2: Copy the file txb.lua into the same directory.\
3: Rename the new file to tbx_Import.lua\
4: Now start up rift and you should have all your old Dimension Toolbox Sets\
   there to load up and place in your dimensions.\
\
Be aware you will not be able to remove any of the sets loaded under Tbx Sets,\
so I highly recommend that before you copy and rename the file go to Dimension\
Toolbox and delete all sets you don't want to use in Dimension Tools."

Lang["English"].ImportandExport.Text2 = "\
<u>Descriptions:</u>\
- Saved Sets: Sets the first drop box to your Tinker Tools Sets.\
- Tbx Sets: Sets the first drop box to your Toolbox Sets.\
- Name (First drop box): Here you can select any of your own saved sets to\
  export to file.\
- Export: Exports the selected set to file.\
- Name (Second drop box): Here you can select any of the sets saved in the\
  export File.\
- Import: Imports the selected set to your own saved sets list and then removes\
  the set from the export file.\
\
To give a set or multiple sets you have to export the sets and then\
logout or type [/reloadui] in the chat to save the file. After that you can\
send the Dimtools_Export.lua file located at:\
/Users/[YourName]/Documents/RIFT/Interface/Saved/SavedVariables\
\
When you recieve a set or multiple sets in a  Dimtools_Export.lua file you\
have to copy it into the SavedVariables directory found under:\
/Users/[YourName]/Documents/RIFT/Interface/Saved/SavedVariables\
Then start the game and then you can use the import option to get the set or\
sets in your saved sets. Keep in mind you can NOT copy the file into the\
directory if you are logged into the game. The game does NOT allow overwriting\
of files when you are logged in."
