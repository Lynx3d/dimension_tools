Version 1.9.3
- Copy&Paste window now supports <Tab> focus cycling too
- <Shift><Tab> now cycles input fields in reverse order

  arbitrary selected item again, instead of enforcing identical types

  current selection as pivot

Version 1.9.0
*NOTE*: All 1.9.x are considered "unstable" versions. The stable version may
or may not become 2.0, depending on whether the addon name can be kept.

- A load of interface changes:
 * New default window style. You can toggle between new and old
   with '/DT style' chat command (requires reloadui)
 * Move and Rotate window gained the ability to cycle text cursor through
   the input fields with the <Tab> key
 * Several windows had layout optimizations
 * UI text now renders with a slight shadow for better readability
 * Window backgrounds are now "solid", i.e. you can't can't accudently click
   anything hidden below anymore
- Rotate and Scale tools now support grouping multiple objects in relative mode
- Right-clicking the item icon on the main UI now sets a map waypoint
- Copy&Paste tool rewritten
 * now supports groups of multiple objects and instance them accordingly
 * flicker reduction (i.e. slightly shifting copies) is now optional to allow
   perfect aligning of building blocks that won't overlap anyway
 * inventory handling rewritten, reduced to "bags" and "bank" options
- Workaround for deselection bug in the Rift API. It should now be less like to
  get stuck with a phantom selection; subsequent selection may not be picked up
  first time however, this is something bugged in the Client, because events
  just don't fire properly after one with an invalid item ID.
